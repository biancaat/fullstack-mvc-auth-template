# Introduction

Asky helps busy medical clinics attend to patient inquiries in an organized way.

---

# Objectives

My main objective was to create a full-stack medical inquiry app that was easy for patients to navigate while prioritizing organization on the clinic side. I aimed to provide a solution to help busy clinics attend to the ever-increasing needs of patients in a way that allowed for organization.

# Who is this for? 

This app is for medical clinics that want to decrease the volume of patient phone calls by providing a user-friendly way for patients to reach the medical clinic asynchronously.

# Optimizations 

  These are some of the optimizations I am currently implementing :
  
- I am in the process of converting EJS to React.
- I am currently designing the medical clinic dashboard and implementing the organizational functionality.
- I want to change the UI to something lighter.
- General optimizations for progressive rendering
- Eventually, I want to incorporate the Twilio API
